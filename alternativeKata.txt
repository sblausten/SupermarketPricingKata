## Brief

Develop the backend business logic for a retailer that sells six different categories of clothes: women’s footwear, men’s footwear, women’s casualwear, men’s casualwear, women’s formalwear and man’s formalwear.

The logic should include checkout, automatic offer addition and payment (no need to provide a way of giving payment). You should be able to generate a receipt via cli.
